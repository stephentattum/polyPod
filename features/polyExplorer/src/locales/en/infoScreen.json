Here we try to find and visualise information that is usually invisible or hard to get to and understand. When we research privacy policies and data behavior for example we are usually looking for the following:</p><p><ul><li>What data is gathered</li><li>What data is shared</li><li>Who are the companies data is shared with</li><li>What is the purpose/reason given for sharing that data</li></ul></p>",

        "<p>Often concrete information is missing or misleading. No two privacy policies are alike and very few share any structural similarity. Since the introduction of the GDPR, there have been some improvements, but we still need to do a fair amount of decoding.</p><p>We also do a good amount of context research to help us better understand what the impact of sharing individual data types could be, what certain companies or industries are doing with user data, or what impacts might be expected from sharing across jurisdictions.</p><p>Our research is an ongoing process that keeps being improved, similarly we regularly update our database. This research is also informed by the work of others in the field e.g. from North Data or independent researchers.</p><p>For the current version of polyExplorer we selected 5 companies and present them as \"featured\". This selection does not indicate any judgment on those companies. We simply spent more time researching them than we did others. The selection and number of featured companies will grow over time.</p>",

Regarding ambiguous statements in privacy policies, we have aimed to use the W3C Data Privacy Vocabulary (in short: DPV) to the appropriate level of granularity. For example, when a vague statement could be referring to a number of datatypes, we chose the DPV term that covers the possibilities more generally.</p>",
